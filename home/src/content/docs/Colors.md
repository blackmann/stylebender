# Color Options

Stylebender has three (3) color options to use.

- Primary
- Accent
- Secondary

# Picking Colors

You can pick a color by clicking in the color space or using the `sliders` on the `color picker` dialog.

If you want to be a bit more specific with your color choice, you can as well enter the `hex code` of the color you want.

## Transparent Colors

If you would like your colors to have a bit of transparency, you can drag the `opacity slider` around till you get your desired level of transparency.

## Color Shades

Picking a color for each option generates up to `eight (8)` different shades of the color.

This goes from a `very light shade` to a `very dark shade` of the chosen color.

# Light & Dark Mode Variants

Stylebender provides users the option to easily set up different colors for `light mode` and `dark mode`.

This can be easily achieved by toggling the `theme switch` and picking a new set of colors for dark mode different from that already chosen for light mode.
