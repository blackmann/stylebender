A backstory to why stylebender exists.

When bootstrapping an idea or putting together a demo for a friend or beginner, trying to get an appeal or look is not easy. The options available are:

1. Use Bootstrap (or some other CSS library). But I'm tired of the same looks. Wanting some few customization means to add an extra CSS file and start overriding basic things. Nowadays, finding the values to override is not trivial.

1. Custom CSS. Lots of time spent writing the same [amount] of CSS every time. And this even means, I need to have some design in mind to code against.

1. Component libraries. Same problem as CSS libraries.

It's for these reasons stylebender exists.
